run mypy from src which contains the mypy.ini config file:
(running from sfpi fails to find all files even with mypy.ini there ?!!
This is a bug in mypy since it is supposed to search directories recursively so
@sfpi> mypy src  should work but DOES NOT even with mypy.ini in @sfpi!


instead use:

src> mypy **/*.py
